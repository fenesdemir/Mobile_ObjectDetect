
# Problem definition
In this project, we are expected to perform real-time object detection using React Native. To develop an application with React Native that instantly recognizes objects in an image taken from the phone camera and then finds the total number of objects on the image.

**Purpose**

This project aims to use React Native and cloud computing technologies.

# Requirements
- In the application, user should be able to both take a snapshot from the phone camera and select a picture from the gallery.
- The images will be sent to a database in the cloud environment.
- Necessary object recognition processes will be done on the cloud.
- After the object recognition processes are done, the objects detected by the image processing algorithms will be framed and the total number of objects will be displayed.
- Finally, the last image image obtained after the object recognition process will be sent back to the mobile application and displayed on the screen.
- The application must communicate with the API on the cloud platform.
- The mobile application will be implemented using React Native.
- The application can be implemented and displayed both on the phone and on the emulator.

# Ease of Use 

If you want to run the application on the emulator:

- First make sure your emulator is running.
- In a terminal, go to your project folder and run metro bundler with the command "npx react-native start".
- Run the application with the command "npx react-native run-android" in your project folder in a separate terminal.

If you want to run the application on a physical device:

-It is recommended that you follow the steps in the guide available at https://reactnative.dev/docs/running-on-device.
